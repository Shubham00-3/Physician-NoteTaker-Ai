Physician: Good morning, Ms. Jones. How are you feeling today?
Patient: Good morning, doctor. I’m doing better, but I still have some discomfort now and then.
Physician: I understand you were in a car accident last September. Can you walk me through what happened?
Patient: Yes, it was on September 1st, around 12:30 in the afternoon. I was driving from Cheadle Hulme to Manchester when I had to stop in traffic. Out of nowhere, another car hit me from behind, which pushed my car into the one in front.
Physician: That sounds like a strong impact. Were you wearing your seatbelt?
Patient: Yes, I always do.
Physician: What did you feel immediately after the accident?
Patient: At first, I was just shocked. But then I realized I had hit my head on the steering wheel, and I could feel pain in my neck and back almost right away.
Physician: Did you seek medical attention at that time?
Patient: Yes, I went to Moss Bank Accident and Emergency. They checked me over and said it was a whiplash injury, but they didn’t do any X-rays. They just gave me some advice and sent me home.
Physician: How did things progress after that?
Patient: The first four weeks were rough. My neck and back pain were really bad—I had trouble sleeping and had to take painkillers regularly. It started improving after that, but I had to go through ten sessions of physiotherapy to help with the stiffness and discomfort.
Physician: Are you still experiencing pain now?
Patient: It’s not constant, but I do get occasional backaches. It’s nothing like before, though.
Physician: Have you noticed any other effects, like anxiety while driving or difficulty concentrating?
Patient: No, nothing like that. I don’t feel nervous driving, and I haven’t had any emotional issues from the accident.
Physician: And how has this impacted your daily life?
Patient: I had to take a week off work, but after that, I was back to my usual routine. It hasn’t really stopped me from doing anything.
Physician: Physical exam shows full range of motion and no tenderness. Recovery is positive and full recovery expected within six months.
Patient: That’s great to hear. Thank you, doctor.
